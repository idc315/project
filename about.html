                                <h3 style="font-family: 'Germania One'"> Blob’s Park</h3>
                                <p>In 1933 Max Blob, wanting to have a gathering place for his friends from the old country, built a small frame building on his farm in Jessup, MD. It housed a bowling alley and a few tables. It became so popular that he opened it to the public as a German beer garden with dancing every weekend. The building was periodically enlarged.</p>
                                <p>In 1942 John and Katherine Eggerl, Max’s niece, began helping him manage the business. As their children and grandchildren came along, they also became a working part of the establishment.</p>
                                <p>On February 22, 1958 the hall was completely gutted by fire, but within a month it was restored and re-opened to become more successful than ever. In recent years it became apparent that in order to accommodate the crowds, a new building would have to be built. This dream became a reality on June 25, 1976 when the all new Blob’s Park opened it’s doors.</p>

                                <h3 style="font-family: 'Germania One'">Bavarian Brauhaus</h3>
                                <p>The entire family hopes that you have enjoyed your visits to Blob’s Park and will have memories to last a lifetime. We are excited to usher in the next chapter with the best place to get authentic German-American cuisine.</p>
                                <p>Now thank you for joining us at the Bavarian Brauhaus. We bring with us the eighty year history of Blob’s Park along with an exciting new German-American menu. Our goal is to offer the most delicious foods prepared with the freshest and highest quality ingredients.</p>
                                <p>Our selection of German Beers is extensive with seven beers on tap and over forty bottled beers. We are open for lunch, business meetings or family gatherings in the Garmisch Room or elegant dinners. Our expansive bar is open and inviting, and our knowledgable staff will make your experience memorable. We hope your time with us brings you back again and again.</p>
                                <p>Our authentic German-American cuisine is rooted in culinary traditions that go back generations. The Sauerbraten or the Jägerschnitzel will take you back to the old country. Just picture yourself sitting next to a Bavarian river, close your eyes and sip one of our many German beers, wines or liquors.</p>
                                <p>Come enjoy our weekly music and a very special piano. This piano was made in Bavaria over 85 years ago, living with the same family for 3 generations. The previous owner wanted it to go to a good place. When she gave it to the Bavarian Brauhaus she knew it was going “home.” The spirits of the piano will be pleased with the familiar sights, sounds and smells of Bavaria. Come and join our family for delicious traditions, and make some new memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
